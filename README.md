h1. Kollum: The Pressure Valve

You are Kollum, anancient Villain living in a dormant underground city.
You destroyed this once blooming metropolis back in the olden days by removing
all pressure valves, killing everyone. But since you lost it and
some dwarfish idiot explorer has found it, you are in a panic to get your pressure valve back.
Or bad things will happenâ€¦
